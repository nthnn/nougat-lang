## nougat

This contains the main project sources for the Nougat programming language as well as its core.

## nougat-api

Nougat's programming language standard library is located on this folder. Although all of them are still at their zygote phase.

## nougat-bridge

The bridge serves as the proxy communicator for the API and API plug-ins into the language core.
