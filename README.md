## About the Language
Nougat programming language is a general-purpose dynamic scripting and programming language. Nougat is a high-level language and is compiled just-in-time. This programming language is specially designed for coding dynamicism.

Strictly designed with so much powerful expressiveness in writing programs and/or code, Nougat is also designed for amateurs. With little complexity, oneself can learn Nougat easily.

## Documentation
Nougat programming language is still at its infancy, which means it still lacks some features that are needed for commercial developments, such as APIs (encoding, networking, database management, I/O, etc.) However, there are already plans for Nougat's future releases. Thus, as for now, the current official version of the release is the pre-alpha, despite its poorly written documentation which was published without any proofreadings.

The documentation is located on the ```docs``` folder but also available at [https://nougat.neocities.org](https://nougat.neocities.org)

## The Development
Nougat will no longer be continued in terms of development. Starting today (11 December 2022) it will be declared as deprecated (as it was in the begining, lol).

## Important Notes
- This language must not be used in any production, unless you're a perfect idiot.
- Nougat is now deprecated and the development will be discontinued.
