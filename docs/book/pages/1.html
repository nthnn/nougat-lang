        <h3 id="1_1">1.1 About Nougat</h3><br/>
        <p><span class="indent"/>Nougat programming language is a general-purpose dynamic scripting and programming language. Nougat is a high-level programming language, and is compiled just-in-time. This programming language is specially designed for coding dynamicism.</p><br/>
        <p><span class="indent"/>Strictly designed with so much powerful expressiveness in writing programs and/or code, Nougat is also designed for amateurs. With little complexity, oneself can learn Nougat easily.</p>

        <p><span class="indent"/>As can be seen above, Nougat was originally created with SharpDevelop and was named <i>Morph-C</i>, however, renaming the project was crucial to not be confused with the programming language that had the almost same name which has nothing to do with the language itself.</p>
